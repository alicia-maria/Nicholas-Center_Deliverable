# The Nicholas Center AHI 25' Chater Project 
In this repo contains all documents related to the Nicholas Center Fall Charter Project  - AHI 2025

## Project Overview 
In this project, our goal by the end of the semester was to provide our stakeholder at the Nicholas Center with cohesive and concise research on various passive technologies. These technologies can be used to monitor participants' moods, micro-expressions, and physiological data to gather insights within their quality-of-life application. This data ensures that the Nicholas Center provides an enriching environment, enabling them to report effectively to the state, participant families, and the overall facility.

### Project Table of Context 
1. *xlsx Research files* - These were deliverables that we presented to the nicholas center to our on-site visit in late october. *passive technologies* xlsx document is the original document presented to our stakeholder after the onsite tour. This lead to a deeper doscussion on narrowing specific research on facial , mood, and micro-aggressions research. You will then be able to find those in the xlsx *facial/mood dectection technology*. In both XLSX documents, you will find that these micro-literature reviews are organized by title, technology type, task description, and hyperlink. This structure was designed to present a large set of research data in a more manageable format for our stakeholders, allowing them to easily select and explore the articles they find most relevant.
   
2. PDF - *Ethnography Questions* - In this PDF, we utilized external resources and literature to explore ethnography-related questions aimed at investigating the end-user and participant environments and interactions. These external resources provided insights into engagement strategies for individuals with ASD, enabling us to adopt a comprehensive systems-thinking approach. This approach helped evaluate the quality-of-life application, including its current state and future workflow processes.
   
4. PDF - *Nicholas Center Observation* - In this pdf ,  you will find documentation of our on site visit to Port Washington, We gathered a collective experience and answered the ethnography questions 
   
5. *Nicholas Center Research Question* - In this PDF you will find research question that were defined at the begining of the project. Describing the stakeholder wants and needs that need to come out of the research and planning phase for implementation of additional software within their quality of life application.


6. In *Nicholas Center IRB* - This document outlines a draft of the proposed IRB questions for a mixed-methodology study designed to test various technologies listed in the XLSX documents. It serves as a preliminary presentation leading to phase two of the project: the human testing phase. This phase will determine whether these technologies are worth full investment and assess their impact on participant enrichment and overall quality of life.

7. *Mrakdown file - powerpoint_link* - This document is a markdown file with a retrievable link to our groups presentation that will be presented on 12/03/24 

8. JNP image files - please find both current and possible future state for the nicholas center workflow process
